# graduate_admission

In this project, the main goal is to answer this question, "Who would have higher possbility of getting admission from graduate school?" Based on the graduate admission dataset from kaggel(https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions), overall analysis was done with three steps. 

## First step, Exploratory Data Analysis and Cleaning Process.

As most of datasets ussally comes with messy information, these little errors are corrected such as column names or missing values. In this phase, for loop and other methods were used to handle data quality problem. After the cleaning process, I have conducted exploatory data analysis by using info method.

## Second Step, Univariate Analysis

In this step, every single variable was taken into account in order to find out basic feature of each variable with data visualization. Most of the variables showed normal distribution, which means that there would no problem applying further statistical models.

## Third Step, Multivariate Analysis

This part is the essential part in terms of answering the most important question, "Who would get admdission from graduate schools?" Correlation matrix, hypothesis testing, linear regression and clustering analysis were utilized in this phase. 

If one went through overall project report, it might be possible to know features of people who get higher rate of admission.
